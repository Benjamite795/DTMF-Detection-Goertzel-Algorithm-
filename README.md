#Introduction
This project provides a Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) detection system developed on AVR Atmega128 board based on Goertzel algorithm. DTMF was originally developed to be used for dial tone representation for control signals to be transmitted over the telephone network. In addition to telephone calls set up, DTMF allows user input during a call which allows interactive applications such as telephone banking, electronic mail systems, conference calls or similar applications.
