#Introduction
This project provides a Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) detection system developed on AVR Atmega128 board based on Goertzel algorithm. 


#Background
DTMF was originally developed to be used for dial tone representation for control signals to be transmitted over the telephone network. In addition to telephone calls set up, DTMF allows user input during a call which allows interactive applications such as telephone banking, electronic mail systems, conference calls or similar applications.

In DTMF, each digit is generated by two superimposed tones (or sinusoidal signals) selected from two frequency groups providing 16 unique keys as shown in the figure below:

This implementation provides unique characteristics for the system such as:

*All tones are in the audible frequency range.

*No frequency in both frequency groups is a multiple of another one.

*The sum or difference of any two frequencies does not equal another selected frequency.


Such features simplify DTMF decoding where the eight DTMF frequencies should be differentiated in order to detect valid DTMF tones and distinguish them from speech. A series of checks are always carried out at the receiver side in order to detect the tones and validate them based on the criteria of the used standard. The common algorithm used for DTMF detection is Goertzel algorithm which is similar to FFT but faster.
